# I ran 1,000,000 Free Aim turns in a simulator to find out how many shots you really get in Expedition 33.

Ever wonder how many shots the Free Aim build really gets on average?

I built a simulation in JavaScript that replicates every interaction — Energised, Marking, Rush, etc. Then I ran it over 1 million turns.

Key Takeaway: The average number of shots for a sample size converges towards 22.28 shots.

Surprising Findings:
There's only a #% chance of getting 30 shots or higher.
The highest number of shots I saw was 79, with a 0.0001% chance of occuring.
Certain pictos like Beneficial Contamination aren't as impactful as they seem like they'd be because they usually trigger while you're AP is high and would have already maxed out at 9.






One thing I'm unsure of is whether the Energising Powerful, Rush and Shell pictos can trigger multiple times per turn.

I’m wondering — are there any other pictos I missed that could make the "machine gun" free aim build better and increase the average number of shots even higher?
