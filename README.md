<h1>I ran 1 Million Free Aim turns in a simulator to find out how many shots you really can get in Expedition 33.</h1>

<h2>Purpose</h2>
I've seen some debate online about how many free aim shots are possible in an average turn. To settle the debate once and for all, I built an algorithm in JavaScript that replicates every interaction ‚Äî Energised, Marking, Rush, etc ‚Äî. Then I ran it over 1 million turns. 

The goal of this simulation is to model the complex web of picto effects ‚Äî Energy Master, Mark, Burn, Rush ‚Äî and determine:

<ul>
<li>‚úÖ The average number of shots per turn </li>
<li>üî¢ The probability distribution of shot counts</li>
<li>üî• How often high-shot turns (e.g. 30+) occur</li>
<li>üß™ Whicch pictos have the largest impact on shot counts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Findings</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The average number of shots per turn is 23.1.</li>
  <li>There's only a 13.2% chance of getting 30 shots or higher.</li>
  <li>There's only a 0.0006% chance of getting only 9 shots from no effects triggering.
  <li>The highest number of shots I saw was 80, with a 0.0001% chance of occuring.</li>
  <li>The most impactful pictos were  Energising Shots and Energy Master. Disabling them led to a 35.1% and 20% decrease in average shot count, respectively.</li>
  <li>Beneficial Contamination is the least impactful because it usually triggers while you're AP is high and another boost was already going to max out your AP.</li>
  <li>The more pictos you add, the less impactful each new one becomes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è How It Works</h2>

The program:
<ul>
<li>Starts with 9 AP.</li>
<li>Simulates one turn of shooting using the following pictos:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Energy Master: Every AP gain is increased by 1.</li>
    <li>Energising Shots: 20% chance to gain 1AP on Free aim shot.</li>
    <li>Beneficial Contamination: 2AP on applying a status effect. Once per turn.</li>
    <li>Marking Shots: 20% chance to apply mark on free aim shots.</li>
    <li>Rewarding Mark: 2AP on dealing damage to a marked target. Once per turn.</li>
    <li>Double Mark: Mark requires 1 more hit to be removed.</li>
    <li>Burning Shots: 20% chance to Burn on Free Aim shot.</li>
    <li>Energising Burn: 1 AP on Applying Burn. Once per turn.</li>
    <li>Powerful Shots: 20% chance to gain Powerful on Free Aim shot.</li>
    <li>Engergising Powerful: Give 2 AP on applying Powerful.</li>
    <li>Accelerating Shots: 20% chance to gain Rush on Free Aim Shot.</li>
    <li>Energising Rush: Give 2 AP on applying Rush.</li>
    <li>Protecting Shots: 20% chance to gain Shell on Free Aim shot.</li>
    <li>Energising Shell: Give 2 AP on applying Shell.</li>
    <li>Caps AP at 9 and loops until AP is gone.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Runs the simulation based on the inputed target sample size, adding each one to an array and averaging them together.</li>
  <li>Charts the frequency distribution for the number of shots.</li>  
</ul>

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Targeting one enemy that doesn't die before you finish your turn. If you could target 2 enemies and kill one, Dead Energy would come into play.</li>
  <li>Target does not break during this turn. If a tareget breaks it is possible to trigger Energising Break and Energising Stun. However, modeling this would require whole builds and specific enemies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps?</h2>




I‚Äôm wondering ‚Äî are there any other pictos I missed that could make the "machine gun" free aim build better and increase the average number of shots even higher?
