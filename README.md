# I ran 1 Million Free Aim turns in a simulator to find out how many shots you really get in Expedition 33.

Purpose:
I built a simulation in JavaScript that replicates every interaction â€” Energised, Marking, Rush, etc. Then I ran it over 1 million turns.

ðŸŽ¯ The goal of this simulation is to model the complex web of effects â€” Energised, Mark, Burn, Rush, and Powerful â€” and determine:

âœ… The average number of shots per turn

ðŸ”¢ The probability distribution of shot counts

ðŸ”¥ How often high-shot turns (e.g. 20+) occur

ðŸ§ª How effects like Energy Master skew outcomes


Key Takeaway: The average number of shots for a sample size converges towards 22.28 shots.

Surprising Findings:
There's only a #% chance of getting 30 shots or higher.
The highest number of shots I saw was 79, with a 0.0001% chance of occuring.
Certain pictos like Beneficial Contamination aren't as impactful as they seem like they'd be because they usually trigger while you're AP is high and would have already maxed out at 9.






One thing I'm unsure of is whether the Energising Powerful, Rush and Shell pictos can trigger multiple times per turn.

Iâ€™m wondering â€” are there any other pictos I missed that could make the "machine gun" free aim build better and increase the average number of shots even higher?
